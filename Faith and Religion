It appears all I have been taught has been a lie or bits of truths shrouded in smoke
This is especially worst with christianity, it borrows almost every story from other cults and civilizations
About every sect in the past thousands of years have had some saviour, a son to their God who was brutally murdered. 
Some were raised after some days, this son hs a beautiful face and brings happiness to many, but vexes those in power
My dreams say there's a great power behind the kind face, we only place amask in front of the powerful bull.
The powerful one is my friend.
He is waiting to assist me in whatever I need as long as I say it.
I make the decisions he awaits to implement.
Calling it a servant may be disrespectful, though this force works for me.
Everything that is laced with shame, guilt or fear (especially the fear of death) is meant to control my mind, 
to keep me from exploring, asking, inquiring, knowing, being the best I can be without judgement.
Jusgemental attitudes are aimed at keeping me below the judge, to tie me to the ground and fly not.
